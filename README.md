# CollabVM++
An alternative client for CollabVM
[Open it](http://totallyNotAUser.github.io/cvm-web-client)

## Name
It is not written in c++, but i decided to name it CollabVM++ because it extends the normal CollabVM experience.

## Official CollabVM VMs
They do not work for some reason, the server just does not send data (the client sends the same thing as the offical client). If anyone knows how to fix this, please create an issue.
